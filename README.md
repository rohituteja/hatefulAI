a project by rohit tuteja and aran swamy

this project was inspired by this youtube video made by Dev Ed:

Staying in theme with the inspiration, this AI, or personal assistant rather, will tend to be rude to the user

This project is based on the WebSpeech API built into most modern browsers. 
This handles speech recognition and synthesis, allowing a user to speak and get a verbal response back.
Alongside the native geolocation api, the OpenWeatherMap api, and more, users have access to a variety of features, as detailed below.


This project was meant to be an exercise in JavaScript and in utilizing different APIs, with a little bit of HTML/CSS web dev
